# MOCK KEYS - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTICE** ⚠️

The keys in this folder are **INTENTIONALLY PUBLIC MOCK KEYS** for educational and demonstration purposes.

## Why are these keys committed to the repository?

This is an educational ransomware project designed to teach cybersecurity concepts. The keys in this folder are:

1. **Mock/Demo keys only** - Not used in any real application
2. **Intentionally public** - They have no real security value
3. **Required for the demo** - They allow users to run and understand the encryption code

## Security Notice

- These keys offer **ZERO security**
- They should **NEVER** be used in production
- They are **publicly available** by design
- This is an **educational project** demonstrating ransomware concepts

## Real-World Best Practices

In a real application, you should:
- ❌ **NEVER** commit private keys to version control
- ✅ Use environment variables or secure key management systems
- ✅ Generate keys dynamically or retrieve from secure vaults
- ✅ Keep private keys on secure servers only

This project deliberately violates these practices for educational purposes to allow students to understand the complete encryption flow.
